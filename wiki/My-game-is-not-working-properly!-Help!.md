While most games do work without any problems, some do only work partially or not at all. This includes

- headset not found
- warped image
- controller not tracking
- buttons not working
- ...

Most of the time its the overly specific initialization of the game towards a specific headset that breaks the game.

Problem is, that we don't own all games. This is a Open Source without any funding. We can not buy any games just to fix a bug.

There are no guaranties! Neither on the time it will take nor if the bug will ever be fixed!
