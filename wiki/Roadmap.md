This post will continue to evolve during development.

## Long-term goal
Monado Driver

## What is coming next
* Encoder rewrite
  * **Purpose**: support any OS and hardware with a single API, using [Vulkan video extensions](https://www.khronos.org/blog/an-introduction-to-vulkan-video)
  * **Status**: blocked by adoption by AMD and Intel, landing of the feature on stable Nvidia drivers

Due to this project being a hobby, no ETA can be provided. New releases will not have a regular cadence and they do not have scheduled features.
